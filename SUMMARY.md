The dataset consists of 4133 images with 130482 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*sheep*).

Each image in the Aerial Sheep dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 9 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (174 images), *valid* (350 images), and *train* (3609 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [RIIS](https://riis.com/blog/counting-sheep-using-drones-and-ai/).
